## 2024-05-23 - EPUB Filename XSS
**Vulnerability:** XSS in EPUB status reporting where filenames were directly interpolated into `innerHTML`.
**Learning:** Even internal status messages generated by the application can be vectors for XSS if they include unsanitized user input (like filenames from a zip archive).
**Prevention:** Always escape user input before interpolation into HTML strings, or prefer `textContent` / `createElement`.
